## Problem
Concurrency in JavaScript can lead to several problems, such as 
1. race conditions
2. deadlocks
3. synchronization issues.

## Solution for problem 1
- In ES5, race conditions are commonly handled by using techniques such as locks, semaphores, and message queues to synchronize access to shared resources. Developers can implement mutex locks or semaphores to ensure that only one process can access a critical section of code at a time, preventing multiple processes from writing or reading from the same resource simultaneously.

## Solution for problem 2
- In ES6, Promises can help you manage the order in which your asynchronous operations are executed. You can chain Promises together using the then() method, which allows you to specify what should happen after the Promise has resolved.

## Solution for problem 3

- In ES5, developers commonly used locks to prevent multiple processes from accessing shared resources simultaneously. However, locks can be difficult to manage, and if not implemented properly, can cause deadlocks.


## Decision Driver
- There are situations where a single thread might not be enough to execute all the tasks efficiently.
