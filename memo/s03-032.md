## Problem
1. Atomicity Violation

## Solution for problem 1
1. Transactional Memory : Provides a higher-level abstraction for atomic operations. Allows a group of operations to be treated as a single transaction, ensuring that either all the operations within the transaction succeed or none of them do.
2. Locking : Use locking mechanisms, such as locks or mutexes, to enforce mutual exclusion and ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time.
3. Testing and Debugging : Use appropriate testing techniques, such as stress testing, to simulate concurrent scenarios and ensure that atomicity is maintained under various conditions.

## Decision Driver
- Lack of Synchronization
- Inconsistent Ordering of Operations
- System Architecture and Design

## Remark
- Inconsistent State results of multiple threads concurrently modify shared resources without proper synchronization.
- Data Corruption.
- Unsynchronization data set.
