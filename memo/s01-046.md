## Problem

1. Race Condition
2. Starvation
3. Deadlock

## Solution for problem 1

-   Implement resource locks or avoid race condition altogether.
-   Avoid using shared state, e.g. variables.[^1]
-   Use atomic operations.[^1]

## Solution for problem 2

-   Implement a way for older, less prioritized threads to be processed.[^2]

## Solution for problem 3

-   Spend resources to either avoid or kill deadlocked processes.
-   Let it happen because it's very rare. (Can be cleaned up by restarting the system)[^3]

## Decision Driver

-   Resource Sharing
-   Resource Lock
-   Thread Priority
