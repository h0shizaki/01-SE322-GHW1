## Problem
1. Temporary update problem
2. Incorrect summary problem
3. Lost update problem
4. Unrepeatable read problem
5. Phantom read problem

## Solution 1
- **Locking** involves acquiring locks on the data items used by transactions, preventing other transactions from accessing the same data until the lock is released. There are different types of locks, such as shared and exclusive locks, and they can be used to prevent Dirty Read and Non-Repeatable Read.

## Solution 2
- **Timestamp ordering** assigns a unique timestamp to each transaction and ensures that transactions execute in timestamp order. Timestamp ordering can prevent Non-Repeatable Read and Phantom Read.

## Solution 3
- **Optimistic concurrency** control assumes that conflicts between transactions are rare and allows transactions to proceed without acquiring locks initially. If a conflict is detected, the transaction is rolled back, and the conflict is resolved. Optimistic concurrency control can prevent Dirty Read, Non-Repeatable Read, and Phantom Read.

## Decision Driver
- concurrency control is crucial in DBMS transactions to ensure data consistency and prevent concurrency problems.

## Remark
- Temporary update is dirty read problem
