## Problem
1. Priority Inversion

## Solution for problem 1
1. Disabling all interrupts to protect critical sections.
2. Priority ceiling protocol : the shared mutex process has a characteristic (high) priority of its own, which is assigned to the task of locking the mutex.
3. Priority inheritance : whenever a high-priority task has to wait for some resource shared with an executing low-priority task, the low-priority task is temporarily assigned the priority of the highest waiting priority task for the duration of its own use of the shared resource.
4. Random boosting : Ready tasks holding locks are randomly boosted in priority until they exit the critical section.
5. Avoid blocking : Using non-blocking algorithms such as read-copy-update.

## Decision Driver
- Resource Dependency
- Task Interaction
- Timing and Execution Order
