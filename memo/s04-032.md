## Problem
1. Busy Waiting

## Solution for problem 1
1. Sleep or Yield : Instead of continuously looping and checking the condition, a thread can be put to sleep or yield its execution to allow other threads to run.
2. Blocking or Condition Variables : Use blocking or condition variables to suspend the execution of a thread until a specific condition is met.
3. Use a Higher-Level Concurrency Control Mechanism : Employ higher-level concurrency control mechanisms, such as locks, monitors, or semaphores, to coordinate the execution of multiple threads.

## Decision Driver
- Insufficient Thread Communication
- Legacy Code or Existing Design
- Lack of Synchronization
- Inefficient Concurrency Control
