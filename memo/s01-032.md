## Problem
1. Locking Read
2. Fuzzy Read

## Solution for problem 1
1. Maintain two variables: readersCount and writersCount, both initialized to 0
2. Use a mutex lock, often referred to as mutex, to protect the critical section where the counters are modified.

## Solution for problem 2
1. Use locking mechanisms to ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
1. Keep two concurrent transactions accessing two columns of the same record/value.
3. Modified the transaction to manipulate consistent data.

## Decision Driver
- Data Integrity
- Performance Impact
- System Complexity

## Remark
- Make both values accessible and consistent.
- Implement concurrency control mechanisms that address both data consistency and performance requirements.
