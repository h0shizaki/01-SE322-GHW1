## Problem

1. Lost Update Problems (W - W Conflict)
2. Dirty Read Problems (W - R Conflict)
3. Unrepeatable Read Problem (W - R Conflict)

## Solution for all problems

-   Lock the resource while it is under operation.[^1]
-   Implement timestamping and allow or reject transactions based on the timestamps.[^2]
-   Implement validation protocol[^3]

## Decision Driver

-   Resource Sharing
-   Resource Lock (or lack thereof)
