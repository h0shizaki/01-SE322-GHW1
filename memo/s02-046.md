## Problem

1. Lost Update Problems
2. Dirty Read Problems
3. Unrepeatable Read Problem

## Solution for problem 1

-   Lock the resource while it is under operation.[^1]
-   Implement timestamping and allow or reject transactions based on the timestamps.[^2]
-   Implement validation protocol[^3]

## Solution for problem 2

-   Lock the resource while it is under operation.[^1]
-   Implement timestamping and allow or reject transactions based on the timestamps.[^2]
-   Implement validation protocol[^3]

## Solution for problem 3

-   Lock the resource while it is under operation.[^1]
-   Implement timestamping and allow or reject transactions based on the timestamps.[^2]
-   Implement validation protocol[^3]

## Decision Driver

-   Resource Sharing
-   Resource Lock (or lack thereof)
