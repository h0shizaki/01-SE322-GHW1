## Problem
- Access problem : when multiple threads access and modify the same shared data simultaneously.
- Visibility problem: It occurs when one thread reads shared data that is later changed by another thread, but the first thread is unaware of the change.
- Limits of Concurrency Gains


## Solution for problem 1
- Synchronization mechanisms can be used to ensure that only one thread can access and modify shared data at a time. This can prevent data corruption or inconsistent states.


## Solution for problem 2
- Synchronization mechanisms can be used, such as locks or the synchronized keyword in Java. These mechanisms ensure that changes made by one thread to shared data are visible to other threads.

## Solution for problem 3
- Amdahl's Law is a rule that calculates the maximum performance gain from parallel execution. It states that the maximum speedup achievable is limited by the proportion of the program that cannot be parallelized.


## Decision Driver
- Concurrency allows running several programs or parts of a program in parallel, which can lead to improved throughput and interactivity
- Java provides mechanisms like locks and thread synchronization to protect critical sections of code from simultaneous execution by multiple threads.
