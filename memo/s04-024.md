## Problem
1. Data corruption when the same data gets modified at the same time.

## Solution
1. Optimistic Concurrency via concurrency tokens: Assuming that conflict is rare, but will fail the data modification if the data is changed since it was queried.
2. Isolation levels: Making sure that a transaction sees data in the database as it was when the transaction started. The transaction can complete in two ways,
    - Pessimistic locking
    - Optimistic locking


## Decision Driver
- The context of the transaction
