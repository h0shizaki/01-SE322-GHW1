## Problem

1. Parallelism may come out slower
2. Shared State & Race Condition
3. Over-Parallelization
4. Data Corruption

## Solution for problem 1

-   Avoid using too many thread-safe method as thread-safe methods can be slower.
-   Test both sequential and parallel approach and measure.

## Solution for problem 2

-   Use less shared state, i.e. `static` variables.
-   Use functions that store thread-local state, i.e. C# `Parellel.For`.
-   Evaluate if synchonization (locks) hurts the problem more than parallelism helps.

## Solution for problem 3

-   Evaluate if sub-problems are worth parallelizing considering the overhead.

## Solution for problem 4

-   Use thread-safe methods.

## Decision Driver

-   Programming Language
-   Resource Sharing
-   Resource Lock
-   Performance

## Remark

This is primarily a .NET, esp. C# source, but the concept is applicable in all languages.
