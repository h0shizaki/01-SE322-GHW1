## Problem

1. Race Conditions
2. Memory Consistency
3. Misusing Locks
4. Deadlock

## Solution for problem 1

-   Use thread-safe data type.
-   Avoid race condition altogether.
-   Use atomic operations.
-   Implement resource lock.

## Solution for problem 2

-   Use `volatile` keyword in supported languages.
-   Use atomic operations.
-   Implement resource lock.

## Solution for problem 3

-   Use resource locks appropriately.

## Solution for problem 4

-   Spend resources to either avoid or kill deadlocked processes.

## Decision Driver

-   Programming Language
-   Resource Sharing
-   Resource Lock

## Remark

Take extra time to design concurrent systems, most of the problems are fairly random and not easily reproducable in production.
