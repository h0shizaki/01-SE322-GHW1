## Problem
**1. Dining Philosophers Problem**
  * five philosophers are sitting around a table.
  * Each philosopher has a plate of food in front of them.
  * To eat, a philosopher must first pick up the fork to their left and then the fork to their right.
  * Once both forks are picked up, the philosopher can eat.
  * After eating, the philosopher must put down both forks before picking them up again.
  * The problem is that if all philosophers pick up their left fork simultaneously, they will all be waiting for the fork to their right, which another philosopher is holding. It will cause a deadlock.

**2. Producer Consumer Problem**
  * The producer-consumer problem arises when there is a need to synchronize two or more reading and writing processes to the same data source. In essence, the problem is that the producer (i.e., the process that is writing to the data source) can write data faster than the consumer (i.e., the process that is reading from the data source) can read it.


## Solution for problem 1
- **Using a lock per philosopher:** Each philosopher is given a lock. When a philosopher wants to pick up a fork, they must first acquire the lock for that fork and the lock for the adjacent fork. Once both locks are acquired, the philosopher can pick up both forks and eat. This method guarantees that no two philosophers can eat simultaneously, but it can lead to a deadlock if all philosophers try to simultaneously acquire the lock for the first fork.


- **Using a global lock:** A single lock is shared by all philosophers. When a philosopher wants to pick up a fork, they must first acquire the global lock. Once the global lock is obtained, the philosopher can pick up both forks and eat. This method guarantees that no two philosophers can eat at the same time, but it can lead to starvation if the global lock is always held.

## Solution for problem 2
- **Shared Memory:** In this method, the producer and consumer share a common memory space. The producer produces data and stores it in the shared memory. The consumer then consumes the data from the shared memory.
- **Message Passing:** In this method, the producer and consumer communicate with each other through message passing. The producer produces data and sends it to the consumer through a message. The consumer then consumes the data and sends a reply message to the producer.
- **Database:** In this method, the producer and consumer access a shared database. The producer produces data and stores it in the database. The consumer then consumes the data from the database.

## Decision Driver
- Two or more users are trying to access the same data simultaneously, they may end up overwriting each otherâ€™s changes.
-  One user is trying to update data that another user has already updated.
- Two users try to edit the same data simultaneously.
