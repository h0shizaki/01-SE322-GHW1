## Problem

1. Race conditions
2. Deadlocks
3. Starvation
4. Priority inversion

## Solution for problem 1

using a synchronized block of Java code, locks or atomic variables like java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger.

## Solution for problem 2

changing the order of the locks

## Solution for problem 3

increase the priority of that particular transaction, use first come first serve approach.

## Decision Driver

1. process or threads using shared resource
2. more processes or threads are waiting for each other to release resources
3. process or thread cannot access the resource it needs to complete its task because other processes are hogging the resource
4. low-priority process holds a resource that a high-priority process needs
