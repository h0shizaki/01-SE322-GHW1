## Problem

lost updated when two users attempt to update the same piece of data at the same time

## Solution for problem 1

1. locking : locking techniques are commonly use to protect lost update in database, but not at all DBMS support report locking.
2. read before write : it saving the initial state of a record before making change and comparing with the current stae before updating the database. This technique avoids blocking problem and prioritize when the user makes change quickly.
3. timestamping : maintaing a last modified date/time field in record, which is updated whenever a record is inserted or updated by comparing the timestamp of a record with the previously saved timestamp.

## Decision Driver

- multiple user access and use the same databasse at one time.
