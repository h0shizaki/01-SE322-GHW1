## Problem
1. Deadlock

## Solution for problem 1

2. Removing the hold and wait condition.
3. Removing the mutual exclusion condition.

## Remark
This situation may be understood by an analogy with two people who are drawing diagrams, with only
one pencil and one ruler between them. If one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler, a
deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs
the pencil.
