## Problem
1.  Dealing the need for programs to run smaller components simultaneously, such as handling multiple requests in a web server.
2.  goroutines run in order rather than simultaneously.
3. Channel Direction.

## Solution for problem 1
The context provides code examples to demonstrate the usage of goroutines and channels in achieving concurrency and synchronization.

## Solution for problem 2
Add some delay to the function using time.Sleep and rand.Intn:

## Solution for problem 3
Specify a direction on a channel type thus restricting it to either sending or receiving.


## Decision Driver
- The requests made from web browsers and serves up HTML web pages in response.
- Don't have waiting time between after each one.
- Channel Direction that doesn't have these restrictions.
