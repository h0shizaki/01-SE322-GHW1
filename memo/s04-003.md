## Problem
1. MongoDB doesn't guarantee ACID compliance
2. Eternal lock resource

## Solution for problem 1
1. Modify the database schema to collect information to single document for using atomic function and locking mechanism.
2. Use another database to conjunction with MongoDB. 

## Solution for problem 2
1. Adding timeout to the lock

## Decision Driver
* Security against concurrency attack 

## References 
N/A

## Remark
In this case, one solution (Applying locking mechanism) lead to another problem (Eternal lock resource)
