## Problem 
1. Dirty read
2. Incorrect update
3. Incorrect summary

## Solution problem 1
using the Read Committed isolation level ensures that a transaction only reads data that has been committed by other transactions, avoiding dirty reads

## Solution problem 2
using version numbers or timestamps, to detect conflicts during transaction commit. Before committing a transaction, check if the data being modified has been updated by another transaction since it was read. 

## Solution problem 3 
Use read-write locks to allow concurrent read access to the summary while ensuring exclusive write access.
