## Problem
- the concurrency in software and systems engineering greatly increases complexity, make it to nondeterministic behavior and various type of concurrency defect.


## Solution for problem 1
- develop test cases and testing techniques specifically designed to uncover concurrency defects in software and system.


## Solution for problem 2


## Decision Driver
- The lack of awareness and training among  dev and tester regarding concurrency-related defect and techniques.
