## Problem

1. when running code, return order will be difference time

2. when running the code, it is possible to encounter delays in generating output, such as when users type rapidly. It may lead to a perceived lack of responsiveness from the application

## Solution for problem 1

collect respond as a list, then every time respond comes in, the entire list is refreshed with correct suggestion.

## Solution for problem 2

using timestamps instead of a hash to address the delay issue when running the code

## Decision Driver

- each task have difference time to execute
- code being executed has complex or time-consuming operations
