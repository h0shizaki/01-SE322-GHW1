## Problem
1. Dirty read problem
2. Unrepeatable read problem
3. Phantom read problem
4. Lost update problem

## Solution 
- **Concurrency Control Protocols**  ensure consistency , atomicity, isolation, and serializability of concurrent transactions in a database. The concurrency control protocol  can be any of the following type

  * Lock based concurrency control protocol
  * Time-stamp concurrency control protocol
  * Validation based concurrency control protocol


## Decision Driver
- When the uncommitted transaction is fail later on.
- When there are different read values of the same variable occurs even when it has not updated its value.
-  When a transaction reads some data-variable from the database-buffer and when it reads the same data-variable later, it finds that the data variable does not exist.
- When multiple transactions execute simultaneously and updates from one or more transactions get lost.
