## Problem
1. Resource Contention

## Solution for problem 1
1. Read-Write Locks : When the shared resource is primarily read, but occasional writes occur, use read-write locks. Read operations can be executed concurrently, while write operations are performed exclusively, minimizing contention.
2. Caching and Prefetching : Utilize caching and prefetching techniques to reduce the frequency of accessing the shared resource directly.
3. Resource Pooling : Implement resource pooling, where a limited set of resources is shared among multiple threads.

## Decision Driver
- Unbalanced Workloads.
- Inefficient Resource Management.
- Lack of Resource Partitioning.
- Overlapping Critical Sections.

## Remark
- Performance Degradation (Lower Performance).
- Deadlocks and Livelocks.
- Increased Complexity of Debugging.
