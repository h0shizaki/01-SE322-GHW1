## Problem

1. Race Conditions
2. Thread Hanging
3. Loss of Synchronization
4. Misusing of Waits

## Solution for problem 1

-   Use resource lock.
-   Use channels (in supported languages).
-   Blocking code (i.e. using `time.Sleep`, or wait).
-   Not mutating resources while a thread, or in this case, go routine, requires it.

## Solution for problem 2

-   If routine hangs while awaiting to send on a channel, increase channel capacity (buffer).
-   Allowing blocking operation to fail may cause the waiting party (i.e. the main thread) to hang.

## Solution for problem 3

-   Pass synchronized resources by reference.

## Solution for problem 4

-   Study how waits and workgroup waits work in your language.

## Decision Driver

-   Programming Language
-   Resource Sharing
-   Resource Lock
-   Resource Reference
-   Blocking Operation
-   Bad Code

This is primarily a golang source, but concept is applicable to all languages.
