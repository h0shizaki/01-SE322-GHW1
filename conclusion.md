## Problems
- **Problem 1**: Access ([s05-033](./memo/s05-033.md))
	- Synchronization mechanisms can be used to ensure that only one thread can access and modify shared data at a time. this can prevent data corruption or inconsistent states. ([s05-033](./memo/s05-033.md))
- **Problem 2**: Access to uncommitted data ([s02-003](./memo/s02-003.md))
	- Currently committed semantics. ([s02-003](./memo/s02-003.md))
- **Problem 3**: Additional performance overheads and complexities in os are needed for switching between application ([s05-042](./memo/s05-042.md))
- **Problem 4**: Atomicity violation ([s03-032](./memo/s03-032.md))
	- Transactional memory : provides a higher-level abstraction for atomic operations. allows a group of operations to be treated as a single transaction, ensuring that either all the operations within the transaction succeed or none of them do. ([s03-032](./memo/s03-032.md))
	- Locking : use locking mechanisms, such as locks or mutexes, to enforce mutual exclusion and ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time. ([s03-032](./memo/s03-032.md))
	- Testing and debugging : use appropriate testing techniques, such as stress testing, to simulate concurrent scenarios and ensure that atomicity is maintained under various conditions. ([s03-032](./memo/s03-032.md))
- **Problem 5**: Blocking ([s05-042](./memo/s05-042.md))
- **Problem 6**: Busy waiting ([s04-032](./memo/s04-032.md))
	- Sleep or yield : instead of continuously looping and checking the condition, a thread can be put to sleep or yield its execution to allow other threads to run. ([s04-032](./memo/s04-032.md))
